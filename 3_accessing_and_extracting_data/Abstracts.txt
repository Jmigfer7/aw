The transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x3B2; cytokines play a central role in development and progression of chronic respiratory diseases. TGF-&#x3B2; overexpression in chronic inflammation, remodeling, fibrotic process and susceptibility to viral infection is established in the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Despite the overwhelming burden of respiratory diseases in the world, new pharmacological therapies have been limited in impact. Although TGF-&#x3B2; inhibition as a therapeutic strategy carries great expectations, the constraints in avoiding compromising the beneficial pleiotropic effects of TGF-&#x3B2;, including the anti-proliferative and immune suppressive effects, have limited the development of effective pharmacological modulators. In this review, we focus on the pathways subserving deleterious and beneficial TGF-&#x3B2; to identify strategies for selective modulation of more distal signaling pathways that may result in agents with improved safety/efficacy profiles. Adverse effects of TGF-&#x3B2; inhibitors in respiratory clinical trials are comprehensively reviewed, including those of the marketed TGF-&#x3B2; modulators, pirfenidone and nintedanib. Precise modulation of TGF-&#x3B2; signaling may result in new safer therapies for chronic respiratory diseases.The formation of an integrated tissue from individual cells depends on the properties of the individual cells as well as the interaction of many cells acting as a collective. Three fundamental physiological processes govern the collective scaling from the individual cell to a working tissue: cell sorting, tissue assembly, and collective cellular migration. Mechanistically, cell sorting is governed by differential adhesion, whereas tissue assembly is controlled by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and its inverse, the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The mechanism driving collective cellular migration, however, is not clear. To fill that gap, here we consider cell jamming and unjamming, and their role in collective cellular migration.
