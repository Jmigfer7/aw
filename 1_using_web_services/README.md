# Using Third-party Web Services
Francisco Couto and Tiago Guerreiro

SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is a software achitecture type that models the several system components by the functionalities they implement, as services (Web Services). The implementation of complex applications involves interconnecting several components by calling these services. 

Web Services can be seen as APIs that allow for this interconnection between heterogeneous software applications in the web by using the HTTP protocol.

# The Flickr Example 

This tutorial aims to introduce the reader to using an external web service in this case to access Flickr accounts and data therein. It  uses the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) which is a powerful way to interact with Flickr accounts. With the API, you can read almost all the data associated with pictures and sets. You can also upload pictures through the API and change/add picture information.

## Getting an API key

## Getting information from Flickr

## Searching for a tag

## Understanding the results
