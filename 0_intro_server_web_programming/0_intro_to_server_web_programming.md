# Intro to Server Web-Programming: the DI-FCUL Applicational Web Server
Francisco Couto and Tiago Guerreiro

This tutorial aims to familiarize students with the applicational web server placed at their disposal (_appserver_). Alongside, in this tutorial we will create basic PHP applications that store data into a relational database, using MySQL. At the end, students are expected to be comfortable with a setup that allows them to develop web applications using _appserver_. 

_Appserver_, available at _appserver.di.fc.ul.pt_, features an Apache Web server and has support for PHP, Java and MySQL. Each group has an account named awXXX where XXX equals the group name (e.g., 001). Passwords and access instructions are provided in the laboratorial class.
